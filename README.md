This repo contains [my notes](scRNA-seq_notes.md) on scRNA-seq processing and analysis, best practices, and a comparisons of different tools and software for each stage, and a couple of practice pipelines. Based predominantly on these resources ([Ho Lab tutorial](https://holab-hku.github.io/Fundamental-scRNA/raw2matrix.html#starsolo), [bioconductor tutorial](http://bioconductor.org/books/3.16/OSCA.workflows/unfiltered-human-pbmcs-10x-genomics.html), [seurat viginette](https://holab-hku.github.io/Fundamental-scRNA/raw2matrix.html#starsolo), [singlecellcourse](https://www.singlecellcourse.org/processing-raw-scrna-seq-sequencing-data-from-reads-to-a-count-matrix.html#read-alignment-and-quantification-in-droplet-based-scrna-seq-data) published reviews (TODO list)

Initial learning pipeline: based on seurat tutorial from https://holab-hku.github.io/Fundamental-scRNA/ on human PMCB data (https://github.com/holab-hku/Fundamental-scRNA/blob/master/data/10k_PBMC.h5)
